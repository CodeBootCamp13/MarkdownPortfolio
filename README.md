## About

I'm passionate about building software to make the world a 
better place and have spent the last ten years sharing my programming
knowledge with as many people as I can. I'm the author of the book
[An Introduction to Robot Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Robot-Programming-Robots-MRK-2/dp/1977685587) and teach 
at theClubhou.se's [Code Boot Camp](https://www.theclubhou.se/code-boot-camp).

## Farming

Recently I've gotten into farming as a way to improve my relationship with
my food and have a small farm with:

- 5 pigs
- 12 chickens
- 10 rabbits
- 2 goats
- and a bunch of cats. :)

## I love Rocket League

This is the best game!
